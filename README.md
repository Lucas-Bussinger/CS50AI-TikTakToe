# Tik Tak Toe AI
## Objective:

This project served as a fun way to implement the MIN-MAX algorithm learnt at the CS50AI
It uses the algorithm to play a TiK Tak Toe game against the user.
with this algorithm the USER CANNOT WIN, but the game can end up in a tie.

## Other uses for the MIN-MAX algorithm:

This algorithm can be uses at many situations in the context of "Maximizing minimal choices" or "Minimizing maximal choices", for example:

In a Chess match i have the objective to win the Game ( of course ), but with that i want to MAXIMIZE my chances of winning, but at the same time, my opponent
has the same objective ( MINIMIZING my chances of winning ), so, i want to MAXIMIZE over the MINIMIZATION of my opponent.

That's what this algorithm does.
